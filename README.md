# rust-robo-sim

A collection of robotics-related algorithms. Also one of my first Rust projects, so the code quality is likely to be terrible.

Goals:
- [X] Histogram localization with discrete sensing
- [ ] Kalman filter
- [ ] EKF
- [ ] UKF
- [ ] offline A*
- [ ] online A*
- [ ] bicycle model
- [ ] PID control for track-following with bicycle model
